    Artificial intelligence (AI) has rapidly become one of the most transformative technologies of the 21st century. 
    It is reshaping industries, enhancing productivity, and offering unprecedented insights through big data analysis. 
    AI technologies like machine learning, natural language processing, and robotics are widely used in fields 
    such as healthcare, finance, and manufacturing. However, the development of AI also raises ethical questions 
    about privacy, security, and job displacement. As AI continues to evolve, society must address these challenges 
    to ensure that AI benefits humanity as a whole.
